      <p><b>Save time!</b>You can print bingo cards for an entire classroom on your normal computer and printer in mere minutes. Writing cards by hand takes hours -- hours that you could better spend doing what you do best: teaching. Leave the busywork to the computer -- it will make sure every card is scrambled and unique for you. Plus you can use the over 950 activities we included!
      </p>
      <p><b>Save money!</b> Don't spend $10-$15 on buying single activities from traditional publishers -- Media Database can make an infinite number of activities! If you plan on playing bingo three times or more in your teaching career it's much cheaper to print your own cards!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Save paper!</b> Print multiple bingo cards on one sheet of paper.

Tailor your activities! If you buy bingo sets from publishers, you're limited to what they have in stock.  If you make custom bingo cards yourself, you will always be able to match them directly to your lesson plan and students.  Try playing vocabulary bingo with vocabulary from the chapter you just finished reading, for example.
