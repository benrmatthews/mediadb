      <h4>Media Database lets you:</h4>
      <p><b>Save time!</b>You can find the journalists, bloggers and other media contacts for your entire PR campaign in just a few minutes. Building media contacts manually takes hours -- hours that you could better spend doing what you do best: telling them about your brilliant business.
      </p>
      <p><b>Save money!</b> Don't spend hundreds on buying single contact lists from traditional media databases -- Media Database can make an infinite number of lists for you! If you plan on contacting journalists three times or more in your business' lifetime it's much cheaper to build your own media list!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Save contacts!</b> With Media Database, you can build multiple contacts lists for your different projects or different media types, then either save them online or export them to Excel for later use.
      </p>
      <p>
Tailor your media lists! If you buy media lists from database providers, you're limited to what contacts they have found.  If you add your media contacts yourself, you will always be able to match them directly to your other media contacts.  Try adding your own jouranalists or blogger contact details, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
Find journalists and bloggers writing about almost any subject! If you can type it on your computer, you can put it on a media list. Media lists, letters, numbers, math facts, social studies facts, student names great for first day jitters), famous people -- the choices are endless! See some examples of what we've done with this flexibility.
